New files worth mentioning are in src\AtlasReactivityEngine10\gen.  They are 
parser.cup and lexer.flex.  These files generate parser.java and Lexer.java
files.  (The Ant build should take care of this generation.)

The Reactivity Engine has been refactored.  One can follow the thread of
new code easily enough, hopefully, by starting in the Activator.java.  It is
our hope that this code is more readable and potentially usable by future 
projects.
