Atlas Reactivity Engine Reference Implementation

ReadMe

Nov. 9th, 2009.

This Reactivity Engine implementation is based on one of the student's term project submissions in 
the Mobile Computing Class at the University of Florida in fall 2008. The original authors are
Ameya Gupte and V. Rakesh Kumar.

We have tailored the code slightly to fit the project this year. Before you begin install
and use this Reactivity Engine, please make sure to read the documents (espeically the 
project report) written by the authors. 

This reference implementation adopts the same set of commands as defined in the project
specification. However, some details (such as how to express a method in the action definiction)
are not covered in the project spec, and the authors made their own schema and explained in their
project report.That's why it is important for you to read the documents first and find out the test
cases.

Although we have done quite extensive tests and picked what we believe is the most readable and 
reliable implementation, it is always possible that you will spot bugs. Please let us (and the class) 
know if you find any, we will fixed those bugs and provide updated versions.
